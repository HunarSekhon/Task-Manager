Basic Task Manager Project using React.js where users can create, update, and delete tasks and add comments

Future Plan - 
1) Assign due dates, priorities, and tags to tasks.
2) Set reminders and notifications.
3) Users can collaborate on tasks (assign tasks to other team members).
4) Use authentication to manage user-specific task lists.
